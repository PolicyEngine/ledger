"""Tests for source-package alias/directory drift detection (PolicyEngine/ledger#78).

``ledger build-bundle`` used to iterate a hand-maintained alias map, so a
``packages/*`` directory that was renamed, consolidated, or added without a
matching alias entry was silently dropped from the merged
``consumer_facts.jsonl`` instead of failing. These tests pin the guard that
makes such drift loud.
